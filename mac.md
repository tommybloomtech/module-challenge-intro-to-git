## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
Git is a version control system and a set of commands that we can use in the terminal.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that manages and keeps track of source code history. GitHub manages repositories. 

3. Why do we create a branch?
Sometimes there's too many people working on the project at the same time so you would create a branch that makes a copy and diverges which you can now edit.  At the end it merges back into the main code. 
 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request allows changes to be made before merging them back into the main code.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
Git checkout new_branch

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch tells local repository there are changes in remote repository without pushing those changes into the local one. git merge allows you to merge forked history back into the source code. git pull brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository. 

7. What is a merge conflict?
Git is unable to resolve differences in code between two commits. 

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Open conflicted file, make changes, create a new commit.
